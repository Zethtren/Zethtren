# Houston Bova

Hello!

I am a language agnostic Software Developer with experience mostly in automation and cloud based solutions.
My primary coding experience is in Python, Go, Rust, and SQL but I have built backend services in all 3. 
I am also familiar with JS / TS, HTML, and CSS.

I am currently a Lead Developer with Nicular LLC.
This position marked my transition from mostly Data analytics and ETL into backend services and I have found it to truly be a passion so far.

I primarily use Neovim (LazyVim variant with few custom plugins) and EndeavourOS.
I'm a sucker for split keyboards and love my Moonlander.

I am a recent father and happier than anything that I can currently work from home to be around my wife and son.

When I'm not coding I enjoy working on the yard and house, eating / cooking steaks, bonfires and drinking beer / whiskey, and travelling whenever I can afford to do so.

This year (and those coming) I feel confident enough in my coding to start contributing to open source projects and I hope to carve out some time to do so.
I have a few private projects I hope to release (mostly around REST APIs).

Feel free to connect!
